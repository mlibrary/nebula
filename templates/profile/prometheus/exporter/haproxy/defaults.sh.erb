<%# Set the command-line arguments to pass to the server.
    Due to shell scaping, to pass backslashes for regexes, you need to double
    them (\\d for \d). If running under systemd, you need to double them again
    (\\\\d to mean \d), and escape newlines too. -%>

                               If provided, the standard process metrics get exported for the HAProxy
                               process, prefixed with 'haproxy_process_...'. The haproxy_process exporter
                               needs to have read access to files owned by the HAProxy process. Depends on
                               the availability of /proc.
