fixtures:
  # I'm leaving this here for next time, since it comes up so rarely
  # that I always have to look it up. If we fork something and want to
  # include our fork (the same applies to anything not in the forge), we
  # add it to our fixtures under `repositories` instead of under
  # `forge_modules`. Also, we add it to the Puppetfile in the control
  # repo; not to metadata.json in nebula.
